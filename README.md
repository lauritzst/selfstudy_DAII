This project was submitted as a personal assignment for the course "Data Analytics II: Causal Econometrics".

The topic was to set up a simulation study that compares two estimators. The criterias were to find

i ) a research design, (e.g., Experiment, Conditional Independence Assumption, Diff- in-Diff, ...) and parameter of interest (e.g. ATE, ATET, LATE, CATE)
ii) two estimators suitable for this problem (referring to the lecture notes which are not uploaded on my profile)
iii) three data generating processes (DGP):
iii.i)   DGP1: The identifying assumptions hold and estimator A should perform better than B
iii.ii)  DGP2: The identifying assumptions hold and estimator B should perform better than A 
iii.iii) DGP3: One identifying assumption is violated
iv) performance measures, e.g., mean-squared error, bias, variance, coverage rate, etc.
